	<h1>The following statement disregards signficant amounts of history</h1>
	<h2>"I don't see color."</h2>

		I have been meaning to write this for a while. I think inspiration for this piece strikes me most when I am sitting in Dubai International Airport, with a cup of overpriced latte by my side. Dubai is a weird place for me to experience, because it feels as though the whole trip here is one continuous advertisement to enjoy a place I cannot afford. Everything seems too luxurious, the families seem too happy, and I don't feel as though I fit in.

		One thing I have noticed while flying US-UAE, is that young people (read: my age) who are from India and perhaps studying in the US seem to have more confidence to ask for what they want, swear in public, and generally portray more swag than myself. One hypothesis I have for my demeanor, in contrast, is that I was brought up in the South. I am in fact, very southern at heart. I often forcibly create conversations with others around me, which I have recently realized is a tactic to put them at ease. It is with a heavy heart that I must admit this is mostly to distance myself from the "weird ones". You know, those Uncles/Aunties speaking in rapid Tamil/Telugu/Kannada on their phones, kids running around, asking for questions. I <i>know</i> what I'm doing. Trust me, I'm an <i>American</i>.

		It's weird, I am so priviliged to be a part of an immigrant community that is generally well respected for being doctors/lawyers/engineers. Yet somehow, I still feel as though I get the short end of the stick - on both sides almost. In my experience, many members of the Indian-American community are unnecessarily derogatory and discriminatory towards other, often marginalized people of color. Many Indian-Americans who practice Hinduism <i>boldly</i> declare (read: behind closed doors) that Muslims should leave America. We as a community have been very fortunate recently to be welcomed into America, but we act in such a petty manner. One clear example of this is turning a blind eye to the Black Lives Matter movement, yet causing a ruckus about isolated incidences of racism against Indian-Americans. If an elderly Indian gentleman is attacked on the basis of being "ISIS" that is absolutely horrid, but why is it such a tough leap for us to recognize this is happening in the Black community on a daily basis?

		I am ashamed of how this causes our children to behave. I honestly grew up thinking that black people were bad, slang was the hallmark of poor education, and only <i>true</i> Africans were good blacks. I could not be more embarrassed of anything else, and I still have a hard time tracing back where this line of thought came from. Was it the media? Was it my education? My school?
	</p>

	<p>
		More importantly, I am curious as to how my paradigm shifted. How I realized the black legacy in America is truly something we should all aspire to become, when I truly started to comprehend the magnitude of atrocities that have befallen our black brothers and sisters. I have a strong feeling it was during my short time in Mississippi.

		What does this all have to do with the statement <i>"I don't see color"</i>?
