	<p>From as far back as I can remember I have always had a million ideas and wanted to be everything in the world! Firefighter, teacher, superhero, really rich person (later learned this means playboy), philanthropist, president, and especially astronaut/pilot. Hasn't everyone felt this way! When we are young we seem to have a million ideas, we probably even called in inifinity + 1 ideas. Nothing could stop us, and we religiously drew every idea on scraps of paper or wrote stories about them in school. I remember doing that!</p>
	<p>I know it is really cliched to say that as we get older we begin to lose that flame which kindled our curiosity, but I am much rather interested in why I think of things as impossible these days. Even when I faced serious adversity in my life I don't remember ever thinking that I would actually fail in my endeavors! One example is school and academics. The entire education system does not seem to jive with me. Every time I start a new class / school year / day I always started with this intense curiosity to learn something new, and could not fathom not doing well / studying well / etc. I would put in incredible amounts of effort, read everything I could get my hands on even tangentially relevant to the subject, then proceed to do poorly in the class. Rinse and repeat daily.</p>
	<p>I wasn't stupid necessarily; I was well aware that I was making mistakes in my study habits and focusing in class, but the kicker is that none of that actually deterred me! That is to say, I always truly believed I would be fine the next time. My so-called 'bounce back' was incredible. The thing that confuses me is why I don't have that anymore. I really haven't gotten much older, I am only still in my undergraduate years.
